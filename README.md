# cub3d
This project is inspired by the world-famous Wolfenstein 3D game, which was the first FPS ever. It will enable you to explore ray-casting. <br>
The goal of this project is to make a dynamic view inside a maze, in which the player has to find the way. <br>
Elegant and efficient algorithms have been implemented to provide realistic gameplay. <br> 
To play the game, you must have Xming installed, as the program displays the image in a window. <br> <br>
